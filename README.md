Software to help ditch those old photo CDs and floppy disks.

This is still in development but contributions are welcome!

My original plan was to watch the removable media drive for new discs and start the backup automatically.  I am having trouble with this and may replpace this will a simple button to start the backup up when a disc is loaded.
